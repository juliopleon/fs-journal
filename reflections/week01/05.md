# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

1. I have had a pretty good week learning but I am still not 100% yet with all the rules in html, css and bootstrap
but I think that will come as we keep going.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? how much I was actually able to retain from lessons.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise? Using bootstrap within html was a suprise.
- What are you struggling with? Main thing I would say would be using media rules for mobile view.
- What would you count as a victory? Finishing week 1!
